# Catalytic Earth

Catalytic Earth is an open research scaffold for a mechanism-level atlas of enzyme
function. The goal is to make enzyme function searchable by catalytic mechanism,
not only by name, EC number, keyword, or sequence similarity.

## North Star

Build a computable map from protein sequence and structure to chemical function:

```text
protein sequence
+ predicted or experimental structure
+ active-site geometry
+ catalytic residue roles
+ cofactor and metal dependence
+ substrate-pocket constraints
+ reaction bond changes
+ evolutionary context
= mechanism-level function hypothesis
```

This repository has moved past the initial v0 scaffold. The current public state
is a scaffold-level V2 research artifact plus post-V2 active-site geometry,
ligand/cofactor context, curated seed labels, abstention calibration, and local
performance checks.

## What This Is

- A research program for mechanism-first enzyme discovery.
- A schema for enzyme mechanism fingerprints.
- A registry of public data sources needed for a catalytic knowledge graph.
- A small executable validation and artifact-building pipeline.
- A base for later ingestion, benchmarking, model training, and discovery campaigns.

## What This Is Not

- It is not a wet-lab protocol.
- It is not a claim that computational candidates are validated enzymes.
- It is not a biological design system for harmful functions.
- It is not an EC-number classifier dressed up as mechanistic discovery.

## Current State

The repository currently contains:

1. A bounded catalytic knowledge graph slice linking M-CSA, Rhea, UniProt, PDB,
   and AlphaFold DB references.
2. A mechanism fingerprint registry and benchmark builder with leakage controls.
3. A baseline retrieval system, inconsistency detector, dark-hydrolase mining
   campaign, and candidate dossier writer.
4. PDB mmCIF active-site geometry extraction for catalytic residues.
5. Nearby ligand/cofactor context from non-polymer mmCIF records.
6. Curated mechanism labels for the first 20-entry geometry slice.
7. Retrieval evaluation, abstention threshold calibration, and a local
   performance suite.

The latest small-slice evaluation is intentionally modest: 20 geometry entries,
4 in-scope seed-fingerprint positives, and 16 out-of-scope labels. Current
geometry/cofactor scoring reaches perfect in-scope top1/top3 on those 4
positives and perfect out-of-scope abstention at the selected threshold, but
that is not robust scientific validation. It is a sign that the next bottleneck
is larger, better labels and harder negative controls, not more dashboard work.

The commands currently operate on curated seed registries in `data/registries/`.
The first source-specific adapters fetch small Rhea and M-CSA samples and build
a seed graph linking M-CSA entries, EC numbers, catalytic residues, and Rhea
reactions.

The v1 graph command expands this into a persistent graph slice linking M-CSA,
Rhea, UniProt, PDB, and AlphaFold DB cross-references.

## Roadmap And Timeline Calibration

The original "one year to v2" framing was too conservative for scaffold
construction. In practice, v0-v2 plus several post-V2 quality upgrades were
implemented quickly because they are bounded computational artifacts, not
expert-validated enzyme discoveries.

Current timeline judgment:

1. Done: public repo, graph slice, mechanism fingerprints, V2 benchmark,
   retrieval baseline, inconsistency detection, dark-enzyme candidate dossiers,
   active-site geometry, ligand/cofactor context, labels, calibration, and
   performance checks.
2. Next automation blocks: substrate-pocket descriptors, stronger negative
   controls, expanded curated labels, and retrieval failure analysis.
3. Next serious milestone: scale from the 20-entry geometry slice to a larger
   audited benchmark where success cannot be explained by tiny-label effects.
4. Long-term impact path: expert-reviewed mechanism labels, learned
   geometry-aware retrieval, source-scale ingestion, and candidate dossiers that
   are credible enough for external labs to prioritize.

So the near-term scope is not "build a dashboard for a year." It is to keep
turning fast scaffold progress into increasingly hard, falsifiable mechanism
benchmarks. Real-world impact still requires expert review and wet-lab
validation outside this repository.
