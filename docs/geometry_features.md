# Geometry Features

## Purpose

The V2 baseline uses text and motif evidence. That is useful only as a scaffold.
The next scientific-quality step is geometry-aware active-site representation.

`build-geometry-features` converts M-CSA catalytic residue positions into simple
3D descriptors by fetching public PDB mmCIF files and measuring residue
coordinates.

## Command

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m catalytic_earth.cli build-geometry-features \
  --graph artifacts/v1_graph.json \
  --max-entries 20 \
  --out artifacts/v3_geometry_features.json
```

## Current Feature Set

For each M-CSA entry with structure positions:

- chosen PDB id
- catalytic residue nodes
- residue codes, chain ids, and residue ids
- residue centroids
- CA coordinates when present
- pairwise catalytic-residue distances
- missing-position counts

## Why This Matters

Mechanism-first enzyme discovery cannot rely on EC labels or keyword overlap.
Catalytic function depends on residue identity, spatial arrangement, cofactors,
substrate access, and reaction chemistry. This artifact starts the move from
label retrieval toward active-site geometry retrieval.

## Limitations

- Distances are crude CA-or-centroid descriptors.
- Alternate conformations, insertion codes, ligands, cofactors, and biological
  assemblies are not modeled yet.
- Static PDB structures can miss catalytically relevant conformations.
- Geometry features are evidence, not validation.
